# LumenVault OS

LumenVault aims to be a minimal NAS OS designed to run on low power SBCs. It includes minimal tools to get started with setting up a minimal NAS.  
It is based on Poky Linux, the distribution provided by the Yocto Project. The slim outline of this distribution allows for an optimized experience.

## Goals

- Add essential tools (such as ZFS and SMB)
- Maybe create a TUI for configuration
